# 3R-Motion
Calculation of the motion of the 3R robotic arm TriVex SL/SLi vertical pack loader. Final assignment of the Kinematics and Dynamics course.

This repository contains the "RobotArm3R" script, which, when run, simulates the vertical movement of the end effector of the TriVex SL/SLi vertical pack loader 3R robotic arm that can be seen in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58p0063SkLE&feature=youtu.be.

The objective of the script is that, known the parameters of the joints of the robotic arm and given the vertical movement wanted to be performed by the end effector it finds the movements that each joint need to make during the process.

The other files in the repository are all the functions needed in the script. In the beginning of each file there is its description commented.
